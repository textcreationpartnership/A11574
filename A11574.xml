            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:6093:3"/>
well lyked, and noted of ſundrie Nobles and Gentleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, béeing preſent at the ſame Feaſt, and inhabiting there abouts.</p>
            <p>The next day folowing, a young maide of the age of fowretéene yéeres, béeing Syſter to this Bridegrome, came to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wedding houſe of her brother, bringing with her the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of one <hi>Simon Franiken</hi> of <hi>Melwing:</hi> bothe which after they had ſéene the houſe, and in what order thinges ſtoode, were deſyrous to ſée the Daughter of the worſhipfull Maiſter <hi>George van Ramyttes,</hi> whoſe name was My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtres <hi>Annys:</hi> who being in her Cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, they both went to viſite her, &amp; doing theyr duties, they demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded how ſhée dyd: ſhe aunſwered, indifferent well. Then the two Maydes fate downe by her, where together they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ferred of many matters, eſpecially, as concerning theyr attyre and apparell. The Bridegroome before ſpecified, had made his Siſter a ſilken vpper body, with which ſhée had dreſſed her ſelfe as handſomly as ſhe might, and withall ſhe wore the beſt and ſéemlyeſt apparell that ſhée had, put on for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> day. But the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman ſéeing it, began to floute at her, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Can thy Father cloath thée thus, &amp; ſeeme ſo poore? Alas Miſtreſſe (quoth the Mayden) hytherto my poore Father hath alwayes to his power appareled me: but this which you
<pb facs="tcp:6093:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſée, my Brother hath beſtowed on me, to doo him honeſtie at his mariage: God knoweth who ſhall weare it out, how long I ſhal owe it, or whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I ſhal put it on again. And though we be poore in goods: I truſt God will make vs rytche in ſpirite, and ſo ſhée helde her peace, departing for a fine Cake and Wine, wherwith they made merrie. Soone after, the Cittizens Daughter that was well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parelled (and ſomewhat vainglorious with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all) ſayd that her mother gaue her all things ſhe could get, but her Father was ſo harde, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhe might not weare that ſhe had, but was fayne to kéepe it from his ſight. The Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman replyed ſaying: my Father byddeth me weare what I wil, &amp; if it were not for of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence vnto the Nobillitie, he would apparell me lyke a Princes: &amp; therwithall ſhe cauſed ſundry fayre Iewels &amp; Chaines to be taken foorth of her Cheſtes, which were very curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly wrought, &amp; cauſed great admiratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the beholders. The poore cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey Mayde y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> knew no Pride, nor had any ſuch attyre to beaſt on, helde her peace, accounted her ſelfe w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> her pouerty, as acceptable before god, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> richeſt or fayreſt of thoſe fine Dames preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: ſaying inwardly to her ſelfe, God is a ielous God, he hateth pride, he puniſheth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vnrighte<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ous:
<pb facs="tcp:6093:4"/>
he comforteth the poore, which haue no delyght therin: and maynteyneth them that are continually bent to the ſeruice of him. After that all together had talked their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, to theyr contentment: euerie one ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerally tooke their leaue one of an other, and after a whyle departed to the houſes of theyr Parents.</p>
            <p>The thirde daye after this Marriage was ſolemnized, all the ioy was turned into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines, for the death of two of the Maydens before mencioned: namely, the Daughter to the Gentleman, and the ſyſter of the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome, who dyed bothe in one after noone, betwéene thrée and fowre of the clocke. This ſo ſoddayne death, brought great terror and feare vnto theyr Parentes, and alſo to the hearers therof, in ſo much that ſome thought them to be poyſoned, and other gaue foorth theyr iudgements according to theyr fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies.</p>
            <p>The next daye after, preparation was made for theyr buriall: <hi>Nicholas Faber,</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of that Villadge, would haue had them bothe buryed in one graue, but the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man would not. Great lamentation was made for bothe theſe Maydens, the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man &amp; his fréendes, for the loſſe of his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
<pb facs="tcp:6093:4"/>
and the Father and Mother, with her Brother and fréendes, for the loſſe of theyr godly Childe. Nowe the mother of this poore Mayde, vnderſtanding that her neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours were in hande to winde her vp, and ſo to ſende her to the earth: came vnto them and deſired that ſhe might yet once more ſée her Daughter, which they wyllingly graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: ſo they went all together to the dead Corpes, (which had bene layd foorth, the full ſpace of two and twenty howres) and the Mother lyfted vp the ſhéete, ſyghing, purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing then to take her laſt farewell, and ſight of her déere Daughter, whome ſhe ſo tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loued. But contrarie to her expectation, and of all the beholders: her Daughter euen as one awaked from a ſlumber, rayſed vp her ſelfe, and with a mylde &amp; chéerefull coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, ſpake vnto her mother as foloweth. My moſt déere Mother, why haue you ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſo ſore againſt God? You haue made me ſorrowfull many tymes, but be you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, God hath forgiuen all, for I am ſent as a meſſenger to you, and within fiue dayes I ſhall returne againe to the place I came fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, where I ſhall lyue in all peace. Therwith they fetcht her cloathes, which ſhe put on, &amp; walking with them, ſhe demaunded meat:</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:6093:5"/>This ſodaine ſight amazed the beholders, for they looked for ſome other meaning in it. But where as this Mayde was ſeldome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeene to be merie: They now perceyued her more chéerefull, and with a pleaſant diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed countenaunce, ſo that the apparaunt ſhowe of her ieſture was woonderfull to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde, then meate was brought, and ſhe dyd eate in all mennes ſight, diſgeſting it natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally.</p>
            <p>Diuers of the chéefe of the Towne came to ſée this ſtraunge euent, where after many ſpéeches by them vttered: the mayde requy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſylence, and to them all ſhe ſayds.</p>
            <p>Beloued Chriſtians, woonder not that I haue bene a ſhort tyme from you: but be thankfull to God, that he hath certified you by ſundrie ſignes, how the ende of the world is at hande, and the day of reſt comming to reioyce vs: Our charge ſhall be taken away, and our trauaile haue an ende: Let vs make our ſelues ready againſt the Sabaoth of our Sauiour, the onely true ſonne of God. Let vs nowe with pure hearts, prepare to méete the heauenly Brydegroome, that with him we maye enter into his euerlaſting King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, where we ſhall enioy eternall lyfe.</p>
            <p>Maiſter <hi>Nicholas Faber,</hi> (Parſon of the
<pb facs="tcp:6093:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Towne) demaunded of her where ſhée had been? To whom ſhe aunſwered: I was ouer taken néere the brydge of the Brooke, by a comely olde man, with a long gray Beard, who ſaluted me, ſaying: Daughter, whether wilt thou? Is thy Father at home? I aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered yea. Then ſayde he to me, come my louing Daughter, I muſt néedes talke with thée, and tell thée that which as yet is hidden from thée: for great effect dependeth thervp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon. And be not afrayde, let the grace of God ſuffice thée, and looke that you conceale not my woords, but reueale them to others: tell what I ſhew you, vnto olde and young.</p>
            <p>So we came to a fayre coſtly Forte. (no Princes Court lyke it, nor any earthly buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared vnto it,) where we were let in. In which place, we ſaw many bright Angels, ſhining like y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beames of the ſunne, all ſinging melodiouſly with cleare voyce: <hi>Holy, holy, holy, is our Lorde God of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baoth.</hi> Among which I knewe a great number: But the olde man forbade me to ſpeake vnto any. Foorthwith I was brought againe to the Brooke, where he ouertooke me. I became verie penſiue, when I thought of the woorthineſſe of the place where I had bene.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:6093:6"/>But the olde man, wylled me to reſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, for this ſhort tyme ſhall quickly haue an ende, and within fiue dayes thou ſhalt be brought againe into this place.</p>
            <p>He wylled me beſides, to manifeſt (vnto the Penitent) the mercie of God, and to ſay vnto the worlde, that he is bent to wrath: chéeflie to thoſe that deſpiſe, and giue no cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite to his examples, which he myraculouſly hath ſhewed vnto his people. Theſe are but warninges ſent vs, to mollifie our harde hearts, and to admoniſhe vs from the dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable Pride, which is héere maynteyned, becauſe before God you ſhall finde it damp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.</p>
            <p>O people full of contempt, deſpiſing one an other, ſome for Ritches, ſome for Bewtie, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for Wiſedome, ſome for one thing, ſome for an other: where as before God, we are all alyke with him, poore and rytch: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, he will not goe forward with his anger, he will holde his hand, and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate it with mercy, if he finde but ſome ſmall number, penitent for theyr ſinnes.</p>
            <p>If you amend not, &amp; turne to God, he wyll foorthwith ſend on you a general alteration, and ſuch an one, as not only men, but Birds of the ayre, &amp; all lyuing things, ſhall tremble
<pb facs="tcp:6093:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
at his wrath. Warres ſhall greatly gréeue the earth, and they ſhall deſtroy Countreyes and people: Men ſhall be moſt gréeuouſly chaſed from theyr houſes, and moſt myſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly murthred. And before this happen, there ſhall come a great dearth: and then God will take his owne that haue turned vnto him, not ſuffering them to ſée this myſerie: but thoſe that liue after, ſhall truly féele y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wrath of God, ſo that thoſe which remayne in the thirde yéere, ſhall well ſaye. <hi>Where haue you bene, that you are not yet deſtroyed?</hi> Many for feare ſhall decaye: there ſhall be great Earthquakes, through which. Townes and Stéeples, Caſtels, Fortes and houſes, ſhall be throwen downe on heapes. Then ſhall follow ſuch a miſhappe, as is not neceſſarie to be ſpoken of, for the ſinne of the people is abhominable and curſſed before God.</p>
            <p>After this great and terrible trouble, there ſhall great Peace aryſe, and the people ſhall lyue in great tranquillitie: there ſhall be want of learned men, &amp; good Rulers: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore good people, let this terrifie your Pride, béeing euen the whole puddle of ſinne, and the roote of abhomination.</p>
            <p>The cloathes which Myſtreſſe <hi>Annys</hi> dyd weare, for the Pride and vaine glorie of her
<pb facs="tcp:6093:7"/>
Parentes, they ſhall become lothſome to all perſons, wherby none ſhall be able to weare them, but ſhal remaine as a neceſſary exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple to all perſons, &amp; as this dooth prooue true, ſo ſhal the reſt come to paſſe. This ſpéech twiſe ſpoken, was marked of many: and others were inquiſitiue, to ſée the cloathes: which béeing ſtyrred, there aroſe a great &amp; deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtincke, that no man could eyther weare them, or abide by them. Which ſtraunge thing, the good Gentlewoman her mother conſidering: cauſed the ſayde Chamber to be walled in, ſo that none may come to them any way. Thus the Mayde continued in theſe and ſundrie ſuch other ſpéeches.</p>
            <p>In the meane time, diuers learned Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers came vnto her, and talked with her as concerning Spirituall matters, which ſhée was glad of. To whome ſhe yeelded hartie thanks, ſignifying to them, that the fifth day was nowe come, wherin ſhe ſhould be taken from the world. But before ſhe departed, ſhe was deſirous to receiue the Sacrament, and Chriſtian Communion of the body &amp; blood of Chriſte, which Maiſter <hi>Nicholas Faber</hi> dyd miniſter vnto her: And all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> day he dyd rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with her, to whom ſhe vttered ſuch godly reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s as it made him merueilouſly aſtonied.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:6093:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>Many people came to ſée her as that day, and to ſée what would fall out. Then meate was brought, &amp; ſhe ſate downe at the Table, be ſayd Grace, thanked God, and bleſſed her Father &amp; Mother, and inſtantly deſyred her Brother, that he would honour his Pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and not to leaue them in theyr olde age: and in ſo doing, he ſhould be rewarded with the bleſſing of God.</p>
            <p>Maiſter. <hi>Faber</hi> came nowe againe to viſite her (as his manner was) and he ſayde vnto her, howe doo you? To whome ſhe freendly gaue her hand, and ſmyling, thanked him of his paynes which he had taken with her.</p>
            <p>Then for a laſt farewell, ſhe rehearſed all the warnings to the poople, deſyring them, not to be vnmindfull of them: And anone af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, betwéene one and two of the clocke, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently ſitting in a Chayre, ſhée committed her Soule to God, and yéelded vp the Ghoſt. Béeing the .xxv. of the ſayde Moneth of <hi>Ianuarie. 1580.</hi>
